          <summary>What is a Children’s Advocacy Center?</summary>
          <div>
              <p>A Children’s Advocacy Center (CAC) is a not-for-profit organization that facilitates child interviews for cases of extreme physical abuse and sexual abuse cases. Prior to CACs, children who disclosed abuse or were the subject of an investigation alleging abuse would have to recount their story, in detail, to several different entities. Sometimes retelling their story up to ten (10) different times. With the CAC, we have trained, trauma-informed forensic interviewers on staff to interview the children while all of the entities come together to view the child’s interview through a closed circuit camera system. Providing confidentiality and comfort allowing the child(ren) the space they need with minimal to no barriers when sharing their experiences.</p>

          <summary>What if my child discloses abuse?</summary>
          <div>
              <p>The reaction that a child receives when they initially disclose will set the standard for their cooperation with the investigation. If they are doubted, interrogated, or disregarded they may shy away from any more disclosures. However, if met with positive regard and being believed, statistically they are more likely to participate in the investigation.</p>

            <summary>How is a forensic interview scheduled? </summary>
            <div><p>When a report of abuse is taken either by Law Enforcement or the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) they will contact the Children’s Advocacy Center and we will coordinate a date and time for the interview based on the availability of the child victim and their caregiver,  Law Enforcement, DCFS and the RI Co. State’s Attorney’s Office.  Parents, caregivers, or community members can not schedule an interview. </p>

                Can a caregiver schedule an appointment for an interview? 
            </summary>
            <div>
                <p>No. Only Law Enforcement, DCFS, and/or the State’s Attorney’s office can make referrals for forensic interviews. </p>

        <details>
            <summary>How do I prepare my child for the visit to the Children’s Advocacy Center?</summary>
            <div><p>First and foremost, give your child permission to share their story with the interviewer. Letting them know that it is a safe and confidential space. </p></div>

        <details>
            <summary>Will my child need a medical exam?</summary>
            <div><p>Oftentimes, if a child has experienced abuse whether physical or sexual, it is safe to have them be checked over by a medical professional. Depending on the allegations, a child may require a full forensic exam. The CAC can also refer children to a pediatric specialist to be examined. </p></div>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Can parents or caregivers accompany a child into the interview? </summary>
            <div>
                <p>No. The interview will just be the trained forensic interviewer and child victim. This is protocol since the recorded interview is considered evidence. This keeps the chain of custody intact and prosecutors/defense attorneys will not be able to subpoena parents or caregivers to testify about the interview. </p>

            </summary>
            <div><p>The forensic interview is the first step into the abuse investigation. After your child’s interview, your child will rejoin you in the waiting room. The investigators will meet with you(parent/caregiver) and discuss what next steps in your case will be. You will be provided with contact information for everyone involved in the case and assigned a family advocate that can assist you throughout the life of the case. </p></div>
