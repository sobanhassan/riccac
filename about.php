    <h2>What To Expect?</h2>
    <p>Our Center is a house, and we have done our best to make it a warm and comforting environment. When you arrive, a staff member will help you get settled in our living room. Non-offending family members are invited to come with, but may not be with the child during the interview process.</p>
