The University Club, 1526 5th ave Moline, IL</strong><br />
Keynote speaker is Kevin Mulcahy<br />
Kevin  Mulcahy is a survivor of child sexual abuse. He spent over twenty years as an  Assistant U.S. Attorney. Throughout his career, he prosecuted a variety of  cases, including offenses involving firearms, drugs, bank robberies, threats,  and terrorism. But most of his caseload focused on child exploitation crimes,  including production of CSAM cases, traveler cases, and other significant  crimes against children. Kevin now works in private practice in Detroit and  serves on the board of directors of his local CAC. Kevin obtained his  undergraduate degree in Statistics and American Culture from the University of  Michigan and his JD from Santa Clara School of Law, where he was  Editor-in-Chief of the Santa Clara Law Review.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This  presentation will recount the presenter's own story of sexual exploitation at  the hands of his soccer coach, Randy. But, it will not be merely a retelling of  the past. Instead, the presentation will address lessons learned from his case  by combining Kevin’s experience both as a victim and a long-time prosecutor of  child exploitation cases.</p>
